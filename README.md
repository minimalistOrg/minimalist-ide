# Minimalist IDE

A web-based code viewer inspired by [Code Bubbles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsPX0nElJ0k).

The main implementation differences from Code Bubbles are:

- Auto layout, users can't edit the position of bubbles
- No lines connecting bubbles


## Development

To start the app in development mode, inside the project directory run `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Tests

No test for the moment as the project is in a prototype state.
